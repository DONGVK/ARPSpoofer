"""
What is ARP Spoofing ?
In brief, it is a method of gaining a man-in-the-middle situation. 
Technically speaking, it is a technique by which an attacker sends spoofed ARP packets (false packets) onto the network (or specific hosts), 
enabling the attacker to intercept, change or modify network traffic on the fly.
